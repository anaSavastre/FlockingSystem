# Flocking Simulation (C++ & OpenGL)
This project implements a flocking simulation leveraging object-oriented programming principles, built using C++ and Bournemouth University's OpenGL libraries. The simulation demonstrates emergent flocking behavior through the interaction of individual "boid" agents.

# Project Overview
The core of this project is to simulate a flock of autonomous agents (boids) that exhibit natural-looking group behavior. This is achieved by defining a set of simple rules for each boid, such that their collective interactions result in complex and visually appealing patterns. Object-oriented programming was central to structuring the individual boid logic and the overall flocking system.
